# programming-journey-in-c
    Hello there! I am new here and this is my first post without any knowledege of how to use Github!! I just learned C programming in college for a couple months now, and I am doing some problems in C to improve my programming skills.Here is my small c project codes, . 
    I am trying to spend at least 1hrs a day doing a new problem and upload it here in my Github repository. And although most of these codes are kind of basic, but I like it and really enjoy learning the ideas and concepts behind it. I hope that when someone read my coding files,it will help them. I will keep programming till i get skilled with it. At last, Happy coding !
