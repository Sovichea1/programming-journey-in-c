# programming-journey-in-c
    Hello there! I am new here!! I have learned c programming in college for a couple months now, and i am doing some problem in c to improve my programming skills.
I am trying to spend at least 1hrs a day doing a new problem and upload it here in my github repository. And although most of these codes
are kind of basic, but i like it and really enjoy learning the ideas and concepts behind it. I hope that when someone read my coding files,
it will help them. I will keep programming till i get skilled with it. At last, Happy coding !
